/// @defgroup CustomLoggerFunctions Implementing a Custom Logger
/// To implement a custom logger, create a DLL that implements and exports one or more of
/// the following functions.  A very simple example would be a logger that writes
/// out the results the end of a test run, to stdout if no failures, and to 
/// stderr if there were failures.
/// @remarks The functions must be exported by the exact names shown.  This can
/// be accomplished by using a .def file or by using the WINUNIT_LOGGER_FUNCTION
/// macro to prepend 'extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)'.
///
/// @par Example:
/// (See @ref GettingStarted for how to build MyTests.dll.)
///
/// @code 
/// // ResultsLogger.cpp
/// // Build with: cl [/I includePath] /LD ResultsLogger.cpp 
/// // Run with: WinUnit -q -l ResultsLogger.dll MyTests.dll
///
/// #include "WinUnitLogger.h"
/// #include <stdio.h>
