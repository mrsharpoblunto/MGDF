        - %WinUnit [-p <i>prefix</i> | -e ( <i>testname></i>* )] [-v <i>verbosity</i>] [-n] [-q] [-l <i>customLoggerString</i>] [-o <i>file</i>] [--<i>var</i> <i>value</i>]* {<i>dir</i> | <i>dll</i>}*
  
   @par Options:
        -  --<i>var</i> <i>value</i> = any variables that should be added to the environment
        -  @ref quiet = do not output to console
        -  @ref noui = no interactive UI
        -  @ref debugoutput = output to debugger (OutputDebugString)
        -  @ref prefix = prefix (only run tests starting with this)
        -  @ref exactmatch = run a list of space delimited test names in parentheses
        -  @ref ignorename = ignore "TEST_" prefix (run all exports)
        -  @ref verbosity = verbosity
        -  @ref customLogger = <i>logger DLL</i>[:<i>initialization string</i>]
        -  @ref outputfile = output filename 
        -  @ref listonly = list tests only (default is to run)
        -  <i>dllName</i> = any single name of DLL
        -  <i>directory</i> = any directory to run all the DLLs in
        .
   <hr>
    @section quiet -q
    Do not send output to console.  The default is to send output to console.
   <hr>
    @section noui -n
    Do not show dialogs.  This mainly controls crash dialogs that occur on 
    unhandled exceptions or abnormal termination.
   <hr>
    @section debugoutput -b
    If this switch is set, output will be sent to the debug window (via OutputDebugString)
    as well as to the console and anywhere else that was specified.  The default
    is for output not to be sent to the debugger.
   <hr>
    @section prefix -p (string)
    Whatever string is specified as the prefix will be matched (case-insensitively)
    against all appropriate exports from the DLL.  Those that don't match will
    not be run/listed.
   <hr>
    @section exactmatch -e ( (testname)* )
    This option is intended for automation; the -p option is preferred for general
    use.  You must specify exact matches for test names (case-sensitive--note the 
    difference from the -p option), space-delimited, and enclosed in parentheses.  
    No error will be displayed if there was no match for a specified test.
   <hr>
    @section ignorename -x
    This flag is only valid with the -l option.  When this flag is specified,
    DLL exports will not be checked for the TEST_ prefix.  Instead, all exports
    will be listed as-is.
   <hr>
    @section verbosity -v (number)
    This value sets the verbosity for the logging. The default is 1.
     - 0: Shows only test failures, program errors, and final results.
     - 1: Shows everything in verbosity 0 plus all test names as they are run, DLL start/end, and trace output.
     - 2: Shows everything in verbosity 1 plus all test successes.
     .
   <hr>
    @section customLogger -l (customLoggerString)
    This value allows you to pass in a reference to your own custom logger 
    implementation.  See @ref CustomLoggerFunctions for more information.
   <hr>
    @section outputfile -o (filename)
    If specified, output goes to this filename as well as to the console and/or
    debugger (specified in other options).
   <hr>
    @section listonly -s
    If this flag is specified, tests in the specified dll(s) will be shown
    only, and not run.
